                <h3>Peak Performance - Nutrition </h3>
                <p>Are mission is to enhance the lives of those we taught, one of the ways we do this is with the Peak
                    Performance packs and other vitamins and supplements. The Peak Performance pack is designed to add
                    life to you years, and years to your life by reducing free radicals that enter the body and slowly
                    tear it down. But don’t take our word for it, both the Freiburg & Sterling studies showed results of
                    lower free radicals and lower blood pressures in all participants and much more. </p>

                <h3>Pure – Essential Oils</h3>
                <p>Our essentials oils are made simply with the oils found naturally in the flowers, leaves, bark,
                    stems, seeds, fruit rinds, and other parts of plants. These oils are extracted from their plant
                    sources through either a steam distillation or cold press process. The resulting highly concentrated
                    oil maintains the natural essence of the plant, which is where they get the name “essential oils.”

                <h3>Ecosense - Home Cleaning</h3>
                <p>Ecosense is our cleaning line that provides environmentally products, we never use bleach, ammonia or
                    phosphates, and we always use the best natural ingredients available. Many of these products are 2x,
                    4x, or even 12x concentrated because saving on plastic is safer for the environment and why ship
                    water? You already have that in your home. </p>
